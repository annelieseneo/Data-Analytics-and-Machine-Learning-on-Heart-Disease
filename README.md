# Data Analytics and Machine Learning on Heart Disease

Task Highlights : 

- Import the heart_disease.csv and explore the data, including the statistics, missing values, and extreme and unrealistic values. 

- Clean the dataset by removing or replacing missing values and extreme and unrealistic values. 

- Set “target” attribute as a label. 

- Split the dataset to 80% training and 20% testing data.

- Create a model using Logistic Regression.

- Evaluate the performance of Logistic Regression. 

- Perform the above tasks using the decision tree. Note: increase the ‘minimal gain’ parameter to achieve lesser tree branches and leaves.

- Compare the performance of Logistic Regression and Decision Tree in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, to predict “1” or present heart disease cases. Note the parameters of Logistic Regression and Decision Tree operators, and change these to achieve better performance.
